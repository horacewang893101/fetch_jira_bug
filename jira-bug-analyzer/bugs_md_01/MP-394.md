# MP-394: [Recommendation] Backend service - Right‑size requests/limits & enable HPA

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
Requests: *1000m CPU / 3 GiB*, observed: *~2m CPU / ~1.5 GiB*.
Over-reservation reduces bin-packing and forces larger nodes.

*Impact:*
Lower pod density, potential node scale-ups, increased cost, and risk of pending pods during bursts.

*Recommended Fix:*

* *CPU request:* 100m
* *Memory request:* 1.5 GiB
* *Memory limit:* 3 GiB
Enable HPA on CPU% of request with sensible min/max replicas.
