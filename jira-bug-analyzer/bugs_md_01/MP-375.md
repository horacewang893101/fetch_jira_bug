# MP-375: Floating image tag (latest) in translator deployment

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Impacted services:* {{translator}}

*Description:*
The deployment references {{nextrelease.azurecr.io/serviceme-babeldoc:latest}}, a floating tag that changes over time, leading to non-deterministic deployments.

*Impact:*
Potential introduction of unvetted changes or vulnerabilities; complicates auditing and rollback.

*Recommended Fix:*
Pin to *immutable version tags* (e.g., {{4.1.0-build.X}}), and enforce an admission policy to block {{latest}}.
