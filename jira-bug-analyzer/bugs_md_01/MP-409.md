# MP-409: [Recommendation] Lack of MFA enforcement for users without Entra ID accounts

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
Users who authenticate to the application without using Entra ID (e.g. local/application accounts, external IdPs without MFA, or email/password–only flows) are not required to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). As a result, a subset of users can access the application and its data with single-factor authentication only (typically username + password).

This creates an inconsistent security posture: Entra ID–backed users may benefit from strong conditional access and MFA enforcement, while non–Entra ID users remain protected only by password strength and credential hygiene. OWASP and common enterprise security practices recommend MFA for applications that handle sensitive or personal data, especially for administrative or high-privilege accounts.

*Impact*

* Increased risk of account takeover for non–Entra ID users if their credentials are:
** Phished,
** Reused and exposed in third-party breaches,
** Guessed or brute-forced.
* Inconsistent security controls across user populations (Entra ID vs. non–Entra ID), which can:
** Create a weakest-link scenario where attackers specifically target non–MFA accounts,
** Complicate security governance and compliance.
* Potential non-compliance with internal security policies or external standards that mandate MFA for access to sensitive systems and data.

*Recommended Fix*

* Introduce and enforce MFA for all non–Entra ID users:
** Require MFA enrollment (e.g. TOTP app, hardware token, WebAuthn/FIDO2, or SMS as a last-resort option) for local or external accounts.
** Enforce MFA on login and on high-risk actions (e.g. admin functions, configuration changes, data export).
* Standardize authentication policies so that:
** All interactive users (Entra ID and non–Entra ID) are covered by equivalent MFA requirements, proportional to their risk and privileges.
* For external IdPs (other than Entra ID):
** Require that they enforce MFA on their side, or
** Implement step-up MFA in the application for those identity providers.
* Document MFA requirements and enforcement logic (which user types, which roles, which actions) and align them with OWASP recommendations and organizational security policy.
