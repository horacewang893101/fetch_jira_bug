# MP-356: No chat history filtering by selected agent

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Chat - Conversation History / Conversation List  
*Severity:* Medium  
*Impact:* After selecting an agent, the user cannot narrow history down to conversations with that agent, which makes it harder to find the right sessions and increases the risk of mistakes (e.g., continuing a conversation with a different agent).

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Go to Chat
# Select an agent (e.g., from the agent list on the left)
# Open chat history (Conversation History / Conversation List)
# Observe that history is not filtered to conversations for the selected agent (no filter, mixed sessions across agents)

*Evidence:* Observed during testing

*Recommendation:*

* Add a chat history filter by the currently selected agent (enabled by default)
* Clearly indicate which agent the history is shown for (e.g., label/chip in the list header)
* Allow switching: “All agents” vs “Current agent"
