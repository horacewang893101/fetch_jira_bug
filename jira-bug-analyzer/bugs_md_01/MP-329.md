# MP-329: Toast notifications are not visible enough and disappear too quickly

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Multiple views (notifications/toasts)  
*Severity:* Low  
*Impact:* The user may miss feedback; messages get lost among other UI elements.

*Description:*
Toasts were observed but are not very noticeable. The display duration is short—often the user cannot read them in time.

*Evidence:* Observation during testing

*Recommendation:*

* Improve toast readability (contrast, placement, hierarchy)
* Extend display duration or add an option to dismiss manually
