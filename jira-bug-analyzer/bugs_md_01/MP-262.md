# MP-262: Storage account credentials are stored insecurely on AKS

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
There is a secret called {{storage-secret}} on AKS after installation, that is of type Opaque in {{serviceme}} namespace. 

This secret type is encoding the secret values as base64, so it is easy to read them and could be use to take over storage account since it contains storage account name and account key.

This storage connection information should be stored securely in Key Vault and accessed via CSI driver, which is already set up in the cluster.
