# MP-269: Entire appsettings file stored as a Single Secret in Key Vault

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
The entire {{appsettings.json}} file is stored as one secret in Azure Key Vault called {{appsettings}}. 

This approach reduces some risk compared to storing secrets in code, but it is not secure or maintainable because:

* It exposes non-sensitive configuration alongside secrets.
* It complicates secret rotation (changing one value requires updating the entire file).
* It increases operational overhead for minor config changes.



*Impact*
If Key Vault access is compromised, the attacker gains all application configuration, not just sensitive secrets. Rotation and auditing become harder, increasing the likelihood of stale or leaked secrets.



*Recommended Fix*

* Store individual secrets for sensitive values (e.g., {{DbConnectionString}}, {{RedisPassword}}, {{JwtSigningKey}}, {{StorageAccountKey}}) in Key Vault.
* Keep non-sensitive settings in {{appsettings.json}} or environment variables.
* Use Azure Key Vault Configuration Provider to load secrets dynamically
