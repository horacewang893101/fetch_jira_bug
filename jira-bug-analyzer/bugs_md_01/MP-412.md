# MP-412: [Recommendation] No self-service password change for non–Entra ID users – only admins can reset passwords

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
For users who do not authenticate via Entra ID (e.g. local/application accounts or other non-federated identities), there is no self-service *“Change password”* capability in the application UI. These users cannot change their own password after initial setup or after an admin reset.

Instead, only administrators can reset a user’s password, typically by generating a new one or sending a reset link manually. End users depend entirely on admins to update their credentials, which is misaligned with common security practices and user expectations for password management.

*Impact*

* *Security risk:*
** Users may be forced to keep outdated or potentially compromised passwords because changing them requires contacting an admin.
** Lack of regular password updates weakens overall account security, especially if no MFA is enforced.
* *Operational overhead:*
** Admins must handle all password change/reset requests for non–Entra ID users, increasing support workload.
** Potential delays between a user requesting a password change and the admin actually performing it.
* *User experience and compliance:*
** Poor user experience for non–Entra ID users compared to Entra ID users who may have self-service options.
** May conflict with internal policies or external requirements that recommend or mandate user-driven password changes (e.g. after suspected compromise).

*Recommended Fix*

* Introduce a *self-service “Change password” feature* for non–Entra ID users:
** Accessible from the user profile or settings page after authentication.
** Require current password + new password (with strength/complexity validation).
* Implement a secure *“Forgot password” / “Reset password”* flow:
** Allow users to request a reset link to their registered email address.
** Use time-limited, single-use tokens and secure reset pages.
* Ensure alignment with security policies:
** Enforce password complexity, history, and (if required) rotation rules.
** Log password change and reset events for audit purposes.
* Clearly distinguish behavior:
** For Entra ID users, defer password management to Entra ID/IdP.
** For non–Entra ID users, provide full self-service capabilities within the application while maintaining appropriate security controls.
