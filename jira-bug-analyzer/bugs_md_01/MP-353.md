# MP-353: Duplicate empty “New Chat” entries after clicking the "+" button

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Chat - Conversation History (sidebar)  
*Severity:* High  
*Impact:* The user ends up with a cluttered history containing multiple empty sessions, which makes navigation harder and can lead to misunderstandings.

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Go to Chat
# Click the "+" (New Chat) button
# Observe that more than one "New Chat" / empty chat entry appears in Conversation History (duplicates)

*Evidence:* Screenshot: [chat-duplicate-new-chat.png]

*Recommendation:*

* Prevent creating the same session multiple times (debounce / disable the button while creating)
* Instead of adding another empty item, switch the user to the existing “New Chat” (if it is already active)
* Ensure session creation is idempotent and does not duplicate entries in the UI
