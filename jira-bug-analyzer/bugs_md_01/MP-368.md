# MP-368: Translator AKS workload defines unsafe default resource requests

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
The translator deployment is scaled to zero replicas but declares very high default resource requests (*1000m CPU, 10 Gi memory*).
If enabled without modification, this workload may force the scheduler to provision significantly larger nodes or trigger cluster resizing for a single pod.

*Impact*

* One workload can dictate overall cluster sizing
* Risk of unnecessary node scale‑up and increased cost
* Possible scheduling failures if suitable nodes are unavailable

*Recommended Fix*

* Reduce default CPU/memory requests to a minimal baseline and rely on autoscaling, or isolate translator to a dedicated node pool.
