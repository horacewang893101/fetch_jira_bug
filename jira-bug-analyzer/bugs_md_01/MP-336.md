# MP-336: Lack of responsiveness on mobile devices (375px)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Home page (Dashboard) - mobile viewport  
*Severity:* Medium  
*Impact:* The application is not usable on phones.

*Description:*
At a 375px viewport (iPhone SE/X), the page is practically unusable. The screenshot shows minimal content (only ~9KB PNG), which suggests rendering issues or hidden content. There is very limited functionality on mobile. Responsiveness problems are present. The mobile version appears to be created without much practical purpose.

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Open the home page (Dashboard)
# Change the viewport to 375x667
# Observe layout problems
# Very limited functionality

*Evidence:* 

* Screenshot: [dashboard-mobile-375.png] (only 8.9KB - practically an empty page)

*Recommendation:*

* Add mobile-first CSS breakpoints
* Test on real mobile devices
