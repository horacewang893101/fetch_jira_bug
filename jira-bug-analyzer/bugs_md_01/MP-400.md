# MP-400: [Recommendation] Cost Management - Configure cost alerts

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
No cost alerts tied to thresholds are configured.

*Impact:*
Unless clients define alerts themselves, they might be unaware of spend tipping points until invoices land.

*Recommended Fix:*

* Configure email alerts at 50% / 75% / 100% budget thresholds to the RG owner and default notification channel.
Keep alerts informational.
