# MP-399: [Recommendation] Cost Management - Define RG‑scoped budgets

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
No budgets are defined. Two resource groups exist: *AKS RG* and *non‑AKS RG*.

*Impact:*
No early warning for cost deviations; late detection of spend anomalies.

*Recommended Fix:*

* Create monthly budgets per RG with thresholds at 50% / 75% / 100% of the initial baseline.
* Assign owners and default notification channels.
