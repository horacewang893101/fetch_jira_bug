# MP-402: [Recommendation] Celery service - Use KEDA with queue length as scaling signal

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
CPU is a weak proxy for Celery service throughput; backlog length is a better indicator.

*Impact:*
Misaligned scaling signal leads to under/over-scaling.

*Recommended Fix:*
Deploy KEDA to scale Celery workers based on queue length (e.g., Redis/RabbitMQ/Kafka topic metrics).
Calibrate min/max replicas and cool-down parameters.
