# MP-367: Missing memory limits for some AKS workloads

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
The {{mcpm}} and {{translator}} workloads do not define memory limits in their container specifications. Without memory limits, a single container can consume excessive node memory and increase the risk of node memory pressure, evictions, and termination of unrelated pods.



*Impact*

* Increased risk of node instability and cascading pod failures under memory pressure.​
* Harder troubleshooting and containment in the presence of memory leaks.​
* Reduced overall cluster reliability due to unbounded per-container memory growth.
* 

*Recommended Fix*

* Define explicit memory limits for both workloads.
* Set limits based on realistic peak usage (typically 1.3–1.7× memory request).
