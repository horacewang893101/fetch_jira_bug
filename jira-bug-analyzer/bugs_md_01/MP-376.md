# MP-376: Aggressive backend readiness probe configuration

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Impacted services:* {{backend}}

*Description:*
Readiness probe uses {{periodSeconds: 1}} and {{timeoutSeconds: 1}} with a TCP socket, which can cause flapping due to normal operational jitter.

*Impact:*
Endpoint churn and potential instability during spikes or brief pauses (GC, I/O).

*Recommended Fix:*
Increase {{periodSeconds}} to {{10–15s}} and {{timeoutSeconds}} to {{2–5s}}; consider switching to an HTTP readiness endpoint for more accurate health checks.
