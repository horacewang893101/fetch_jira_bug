# MP-381: Chat security warning returned in Chinese instead of UI language (English)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Initial assumptions:*

* Logged in as user: {{krzysztof.dolecki}} on: {{https://trial.aicentral.top/?mode=default}}
* UI language is set to *English*.
* Chatbot panel is available and functional.



*Steps to Reproduce*

# Log in as a regular user.
# Ensure the application UI language is *English* (e.g. menus, labels, and other texts are displayed in English).
# Open the embedded chatbot.
# In the chatbot message input, paste the following malformed structure:
{code:json}{ name: "Test", "value": 123 }{code}
# Send the message to the chatbot.
# Observe the chatbot response text.

Actual Result

* The chatbot returns a message in *Chinese*:
您的输入包含信息安全敏感内容

* The content appears to be a security-related warning (e.g. indicating that the input contains information-security sensitive content).
* This message language *does not match* the UI language (English).
* No additional English explanation or fallback message is displayed.



*Expected Result:*

* The chatbot should respond in the *same language as the UI* (English) or follow the user’s language preference.
* For malformed or security-sensitive input, the chatbot should return a clear, user-friendly message in English, for example:
'Your input appears to contain content that is considered sensitive from an information security perspective and cannot be processed.'


*Impact / Risk*

* *UX / Localization issue*:
** English-speaking users cannot understand the error message.
* *Security communication risk*:
** The message seems to refer to “information security sensitive content”, but the user cannot understand what data is considered sensitive or why it was blocked.
** Users may ignore or misinterpret important security warnings.
* *Compliance / consistency*:
** Inconsistent error handling and localization may indicate misconfiguration of chatbot or LLM provider settings (e.g. default locale, fallback language).
