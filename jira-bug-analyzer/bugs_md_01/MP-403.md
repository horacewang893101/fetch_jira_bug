# MP-403: [Recommendation] Define PodDisruptionBudgets for increased AKS reliability

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
No PDBs are set for critical services on AKS.

*Impact:*
Drains/upgrades may evict too many replicas simultaneously, causing downtime.

*Recommended Fix:*
Define PDBs for Backend, Celery, Knowledge (and other critical services) to guarantee minimum available replicas during node maintenance.
