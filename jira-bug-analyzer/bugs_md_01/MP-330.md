# MP-330: Untranslated i18n keys in the Model Set form

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Admin → Model → Model Set → Add  
*Severity:* High  
*Impact:* The UI displays technical keys instead of readable labels.

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Go to Admin → Model → Model Set
# Click "Add"
# In the "LLM" section, notice texts like "llms.template.chat_openai.display_name OpenAI..."

*Evidence:* Observation during testing

*Recommendation:* Fix the translation mechanism and ensure all keys are translated.
