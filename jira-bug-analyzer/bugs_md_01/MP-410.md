# MP-410: [Recommendation] Lack of configuration options to customize the “User Notice” dialog for new users

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
The application displays a “User Notice” dialog to new users when they first access the product (see example in the attached screenshot). This dialog contains static, vendor‑defined text (disclaimer, legal/ethical guidelines, usage notice) and a single acknowledgment button (“I Understand”).

There is currently *no configuration option* exposed in the admin or settings UI to customize the content or behavior of this “User Notice” window. Administrators cannot modify the wording, add organization-specific legal language, data protection clauses, or references to internal policies. This limits the ability of tenant owners/customers to align the notice with their own compliance, legal, security, and acceptable‑use requirements.

*Impact*

* Organizations cannot embed their own mandatory legal / compliance wording (e.g. internal Acceptable Use Policy, data handling obligations, jurisdiction-specific notices).
* Increased risk of:
** Misalignment between what users see in the product and what is formally required by internal policies or external regulations.
** Legal ambiguity if an incident occurs and the only visible user notice is the generic vendor text rather than the company’s approved disclaimer.
* Reduces flexibility for enterprise customers who need:
** Different notices for different regions or business units,
** Localized language or jurisdiction-specific clauses (e.g. GDPR, industry-specific regulations).

*Recommended Fix*

* Add an *admin-configurable User Notice* feature, for example:
** A configuration section where tenant admins can define:
*** Custom title,
*** Custom rich-text/body content (with basic formatting),
*** Optional links to internal policies.
** Support for localization / multiple language variants where applicable.
* Allow admins to configure *when and to whom* the notice is shown:
** On first login only, on every login, or after content changes (versioned notice).
** Optionally scoped by role, group, or region.
* Provide a mechanism to:
** Track whether a user has acknowledged the latest version of the notice (e.g. versioned consent flag per user),
** Re-prompt users when the notice text is updated by administrators.
* Ensure that customization is validated (no script execution, safe HTML subset) to avoid introducing security risks while still giving customers sufficient flexibility to meet their legal and compliance requirements.
