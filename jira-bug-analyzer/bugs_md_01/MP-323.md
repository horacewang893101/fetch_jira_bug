# MP-323: Inconsistent and inadequate validation messages in forms (MCP)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* AI Studio → MCP → Create  
*Severity:* Critical  
*Impact:* The user does not understand what to fix; this makes completing the form difficult.

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Path: Dashboard → AI Studio → MCP → Create
# Open the MCP creation form
# Leave required fields empty or enter invalid data
# Observe the validation message wording and style

*Evidence:* Observation during testing

*Additional Notes:*

* The message “The agent classification cannot be empty” does not match the context (it refers to an “agent”, not an MCP).
* The error message “Please input !” under “MCP Service Configuration” is incorrect and feels aggressive (as if the UI is shouting).

*Recommendation:*

* Standardize the format: “Please enter/Please select [field name]”
* Make the content context-accurate (e.g., “The MCP classification cannot be empty”)
* Avoid exclamation marks and vague/short messages like “Please input !”
