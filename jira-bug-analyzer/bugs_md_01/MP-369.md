# MP-369: AKS node pool VM Scale Set created without autoscaling configuration

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
The AKS node pool is backed by a Virtual Machine Scale Set configured with a single instance and no autoscaling rules.
While functional, this configuration does not provide real elasticity and contradicts the intended use of VMSS in AKS environments.

Autoscaling on AKS resource is also disabled:

*Impact*

* Manual intervention required to handle increased load
* Single‑node dependency reduces fault tolerance
* Limited scalability despite VMSS abstraction

*Recommended Fix*

* Enable AKS Cluster Autoscaler and define minimum/maximum node counts per node pool.
* Use a multi-node baseline where availability is required, and allow scale-out within defined bounds.
* Instead of having single big-sized VM inside a VMSS, it would be better to have multiple smaller-sized VMs that AKS can automatically scale depending on the current needs.
