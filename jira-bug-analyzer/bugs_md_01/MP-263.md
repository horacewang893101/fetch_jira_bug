# MP-263: Enable encryption at rest for Kubernetes Secrets in AKS

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
AKS stores sensitive credentials (for example kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson registry token and storage account credentials) as Kubernetes Secret objects in etcd; without explicit KMS-based etcd encryption, these secrets rely mainly on default platform storage protections and remain retrievable via any principal with read access to Secrets.

Enabling AKS KMS-based etcd encryption using a customer-managed key in Azure Key Vault could be used to provide stronger encryption-at-rest for Secrets stored in etcd (including enabling key rotation).
