# MP-408: [Recommendation] Minimize exposure of detailed version and build metadata to unauthenticated users

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Description*

The application currently exposes detailed version and build metadata (e.g. {{version}}, {{buildId}}, {{buildDate}}, {{releaseHash}}) via a publicly accessible endpoint such as {{/version.json}}. This information is available without authentication and can be used for fingerprinting the deployed build and correlating it with known vulnerabilities or exploits.

In line with OWASP guidance on information leakage and fingerprinting, only the minimal information strictly required for user-facing functionality should be exposed to anonymous users. Internal build identifiers, commit hashes, and precise build timestamps are primarily operational details and do not need to be publicly available.

*Impact*

* Facilitates application fingerprinting by unauthenticated attackers.
* Makes it easier to map the exact deployed build to publicly known vulnerabilities and exploits.
* Increases the amount of information available for targeted attacks and reconnaissance.
* May conflict with internal security policies that require minimizing unnecessary information disclosure.

*Recommended Fix*

* Restrict {{/version.json}} (or equivalent endpoints) to expose only minimal, high-level information required for end users, for example:
** {{version}}: a high-level application version string (e.g. {{"4.1.0"}}).
* Remove or restrict the following fields from unauthenticated/public responses:
** {{releaseHash}} (commit or artifact hash),
** {{buildId}},
** {{buildDate}},
** any other internal build or pipeline identifiers.
* If detailed build metadata is needed:
** Expose it only in authenticated administrative or support interfaces, or
** Provide it via internal monitoring/observability tools not accessible from the public internet.
* Document this behavior as a conscious decision aligned with OWASP’s recommendations on minimizing information leakage and fingerprinting.
