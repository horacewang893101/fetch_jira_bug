**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
When digging into the local storage of the frontend application, we can easily see that there is an api key with all the details needed to connect to Whisper model:

*Suggested fix*

* Don’t expose API key or any other secrets in local storage, store and read from key vault if possible
