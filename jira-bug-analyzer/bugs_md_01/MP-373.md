# MP-373: Missing NetworkPolicies for service intercommunication on AKS

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Impacted services:* {{backend}}, {{celery}}, {{frontend}}, {{knowledge}}, {{mcpm}}, {{translator}} (namespace {{serviceme}})

*Description:*
No NetworkPolicies are defined, allowing unrestricted pod-to-pod communication in the namespace.

*Impact:*
Enables lateral movement if a pod is compromised and prevents zero-trust segmentation across the service mesh.

*Recommended Fix:*
Establish a default deny-all baseline and add allow-list NetworkPolicies per service to tightly control ingress/egress to required peers and external endpoints (DB, Key Vault, ACR, etc.).
