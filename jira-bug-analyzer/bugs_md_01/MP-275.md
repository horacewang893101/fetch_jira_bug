# MP-275: Monolithic Secret Pattern for Logging Config (serilogsettings)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Description*
The entire Serilog configuration, including sensitive DB credentials, is stored as a single Key Vault secret ({{serilogsettings}}). This prevents granular RBAC and complicates rotation.

*Impact*
Compromise of {{serilogsettings}} exposes DB credentials and logging schema details.

*Evidence*
Secret includes full Serilog config with connection string and table schema.



*Recommended Fix*

* Split sensitive values (e.g. DB connection string) into a dedicated Key Vault secrets.
* Keep non-sensitive logging configuration in app settings or code.
