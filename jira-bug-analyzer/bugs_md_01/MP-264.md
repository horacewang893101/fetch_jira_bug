# MP-264: Name inconsistencies of secrets stored in Key Vault

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
Two secrets in Azure Key Vault are named in a way that doesn’t clearly indicate which workload uses them, which creates ambiguity during troubleshooting, rotation, and access reviews.



*Currently:*

* appsettings – used by the knowledge container, but the name doesn’t imply that.
* serilogsettings – used by the knowledge container, but it’s not obvious from the name.
* Other secrets follow a clearer pattern (e.g., backend-env, celery-env, translator-env).



*Impact:*

* Harder to identify ownership/scope of these secrets.
* Higher risk of accidental modification/rotation/removal impacting the knowledge container.
* Slower incident response and less reliable access governance.



*Suggested solution:*

* Define and enforce a naming convention that reflects consumer/ownership (e.g., knowledge-appsettings, knowledge-serilogsettings, or appsettings-knowledge).
