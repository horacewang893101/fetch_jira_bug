# MP-295: Secure Redis Cache resource with managed identity

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
Azure Portal shows the recommendation: “Activate Microsoft Entra ID and disable access keys…” on existing after installation Azure Cache for Redis, while it is configured for key-based authentication, and clients connect using access keys stored in configuration/Key Vault instead of using Managed Identity (Entra ID).



*Impact:* 

This increases security risk because access keys are long-lived shared secrets and rotation is operationally heavy. Disabling access keys will also terminate all current client connections, so the remediation requires a planned maintenance window.



*Recommended fix:* 

Enable Microsoft Entra ID authentication on the existing cache, grant the relevant applications’ managed identities the required RBAC permissions, and update clients to use Entra ID token authentication and afterwards disable access keys.
