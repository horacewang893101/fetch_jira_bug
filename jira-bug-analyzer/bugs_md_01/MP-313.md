# MP-313: No indication of which filters are active in tables

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Multiple tables and views with filters across the application  
*Severity:* Critical  
*Impact:* Users do not know the current table state, make incorrect decisions, and waste time guessing which settings are applied.

*Description:*
A recurring issue across the app: after applying filters there is no clear indication of what is selected/active (e.g., no chips/badges showing active filters).

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Open a table: AI Studio → Agent
# Apply a filter
# Close the filter panel / interact with the table
# Observe there is no readable indication of active filters

*Evidence:*

*Recommendation:*

* Display active filters as chips/badges above the table
* Add an active filter counter on the filter icon
* Provide an easy “Clear all filters” option within the table context
