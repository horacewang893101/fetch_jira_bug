# MP-337: Missing skeleton loaders during loading

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Home page (Dashboard) - page loading  
*Severity:* Medium  
*Impact:* Users don’t know if the page is loading.

*Description:*
When loading the home page on a slow connection (3G simulation), there are no skeleton screens or loading indicators. The page stays blank for several seconds.

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Open DevTools → Network → Throttle: 3G
# Refresh the home page (Dashboard)
# Observe lack of feedback during loading

*Evidence:* 

* Screenshot: [dashboard-loading-slow-network.png] (only 4.3KB - blank page)
* Screenshot: [dashboard-long-loading.png]

*Recommendation:*

* Add skeleton loaders for main sections
* Show a loading spinner for API operations
