# MP-425: No APM / distributed tracing capability installed

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
* *Affected:* All AKS services
* *Description:* No Application Insights (or equivalent) is created/configured; services are not instrumented for tracing, dependency telemetry, and exceptions.
* *Impact:* No distributed tracing; slow root-cause identification across services and dependencies.
* *Recommended fix (what/where):*
** Deploy an *APM/tracing backend* (self-hosted if required by your product model).
** Instrument *every AKS service* to emit traces, request metrics, exceptions, and dependency spans; enforce propagation of trace context across HTTP/gRPC and dependency clients.
