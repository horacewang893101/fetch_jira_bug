# MP-415: Bundle size is too large on the login page

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Login Page  
*Severity:* Critical  
*Impact:* Long load time for the login page, which should be the lightest page in the application. Negative impact on First Contentful Paint and Time to Interactive.

*Current Behavior:*

* The login page loads the full JS bundle of the entire application
* Users wait for code they do not need
* Interactions are blocked while parsing JS

*Before Example:*

* JS bundle loaded on the login page: full application size
* Time to interactive: significantly above acceptable values

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Open DevTools → Network
# Go to the login page
# Observe the size of downloaded JS assets
# Compare against best practices for login pages (~50–100KB)

*Recommendation:*

* The login page should have a minimal bundle size
* Consider a static page or Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for the login page
* Split the login page into a separate, small chunk
* Remove unnecessary dependencies from the login page bundle
* Lazy load the rest of the application modules only after login

*Affected Screens:*

* Login Page
