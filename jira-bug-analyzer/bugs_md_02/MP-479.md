# MP-479: No centralized logging/metrics/tracing for AKS + managed services

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
The Terraform provisions AKS/PG/Redis/Key Vault/Storage, but there’s no Azure Monitor Container Insights / Log Analytics workspace, no diagnostic settings, and no tracing pipeline defined. \

Risk: When installs or workloads fail, there’s no “single pane” for logs/metrics; MTTR increases and intermittent failures become extremely hard to diagnose.
