# MP-418: Logs available only in Knowledge service (no cross-service application logging)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
* *Affected:* AKS services (all except Knowledge), Knowledge service (acts as the only baseline)
* *Description:* Log verification is limited to the Knowledge service; it enriches events via Serilog with backend + PostgreSQL connection context, and other AKS services are not confirmed to log in the same structured/consistent way.
* *Impact:* Cross-service troubleshooting is impaired; log queries cannot reliably compare/trace behavior across services.
* *Recommended fix:*
** In *each AKS service* (Deployment), implement the same structured logging baseline (Serilog or equivalent) and enforce common fields: {{service}}, {{env}}, {{traceId/correlationId}}, {{requestPath}}, {{statusCode}}, {{durationMs}}.
** Ensure configuration injection is not unique to Knowledge service (e.g., replicate Key Vault-based config consumption pattern across all services or move to a shared mechanism).
