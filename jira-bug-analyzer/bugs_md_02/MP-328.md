# MP-328: "Feature under development" messages without specifics

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Views/features that are unavailable / under construction  
*Severity:* High  
*Impact:* The user loses trust and does not know whether/when the feature will be available; the message looks like a placeholder.

*Description:*
These should not be shown if there are no specifics (no release date, no plan, no CTA).

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Navigate to a feature view that is not ready
# Observe the message “Feature under development” with no additional details

*Evidence:*
Screenshot: [feature-under-development.png]

*Recommendation:*

* Replace placeholders with concrete information (what and when), or hide the entry from navigation
* Add a CTA (e.g., “Notify me”, link to roadmap/feedback) if it makes sense
