# MP-146: Slow application loading and excessive “Loading…” states (First Time User Experience)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
{noformat}**Location:** Entire application  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Users lose the sense of control and become frustrated; onboarding and basic navigation feel noticeably slowed down.

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Repro path: entire application
2. Navigate between views (Dashboard, AI Studio, Knowledge, etc.)
3. Observe frequent loading screens/messages and delays

**Evidence:** 
- Screenshot: [dashborad-long-loading.png]

**Additional Notes:**
- Slow loading of images / UI assets
- Many “loading” states even for simple interactions
- Lack of caching in the application (e.g., user/config data is fetched repeatedly)

**Recommendation:**
- Introduce caching for user data and assets (where safe)
- Load data in parallel and reduce global blocking loaders
- Replace long loading messages with skeletons / partial rendering{noformat}
