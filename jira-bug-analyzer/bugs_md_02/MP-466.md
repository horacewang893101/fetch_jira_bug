# MP-466: Recommendation - Standardize path casing and pluralization (snake_case vs kebab-case vs camelCase)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
Paths mix {{snake_case}} (~520), {{kebab-case}} (~70), and one {{camelCase}}; pluralization also inconsistent (e.g., {{agents/agent}}, {{users/user}}). Choose one style (recommend kebab-case or snake_case) and plural resource names consistently. 

Apart from that paths include redundant and confusing segments (e.g., {{/lite_api/v2/api/.../api/...}})

Example: {{/webapi/lite_api/v2/api/chat-with-bot/upload-files/}} repeats “api” thrice. Simplify to reduce cognitive load and routing complexity.
