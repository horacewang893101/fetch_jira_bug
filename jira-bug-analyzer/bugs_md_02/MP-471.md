# MP-471: Real credentials checked into user configuration files

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
Real credentials are saved into user configs. 

Risk: Immediate credential disclosure to anyone with access to the copied workspace/container image; also encourages reuse of weak/static credentials in future installs.
