# MP-417: High number of XHR requests / potential N+1, missing batching/caching

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Entire application  
*Severity:* Critical (P0)  
*Impact:* A high number of requests increases network and server load, slows down the application, and increases resource consumption.

*Current Behavior:*

* Many individual XHR requests instead of batch requests
* No caching for repeated data
* Potential N+1 problem in the API

*Recommendation:*

* Implement batch requests (combine multiple requests into one)
* Add caching for repeated data (SWR/React Query pattern)
* Resolve N+1 issues in the API
