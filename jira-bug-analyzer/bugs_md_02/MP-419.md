# MP-419: No centralized log collection configured (logs not sent to a shared destination)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
* *Affected:* All AKS services
* *Description:* Collected logs are not forwarded to a centralized place, so there is no unified querying/retention/access model.
* *Impact:* Slow incident response, fragmented investigations, and no consistent retention for audit/RCA.
* *Recommended fix:*
** Create a central log destination (e.g., Log Analytics Workspace) and define retention + RBAC for it.
** Configure log forwarding/agents so all AKS workloads send logs to that central destination (stdout/stderr + application logs).
