# MP-469: Incorrect error message for API failures shown as a network issue

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Entire application (API-dependent operations)  
*Severity:* High  
*Impact:* Users are misled into thinking the problem is on their side (internet connection) even when the root cause is a server error (e.g., 500). This increases frustration, delays recovery, and can lead to excessive retries.

*Description:*
When the API returns a server error (e.g., HTTP 500), the UI shows messages like “Network Error” / “Network Error. Check connection”, which is inaccurate.

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Trigger any action that sends an API request
# Force the backend to respond with an error (e.g., HTTP 500)
# Observe the error message shown in the UI

*Evidence:* Observation during tests
