# MP-477: Infinite recursion/retry loops in installer scripts

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
Several scripts retry indefinitely (Terraform apply loop, recursive re-entry on failures). 

Risk: A transient or permanent failure can cause “run forever” behavior, repeated API calls, unintended repeated actions (including repeated init job attempts), and unpredictable operator experience.
