# MP-422: AKS monitoring/insights not configured (no infrastructure insights)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
* *Affected:* AKS resource
* *Description:* AKS monitoring is not enabled; cluster-level health signals (node/pod trends, kube events) aren’t available.
* *Impact:* Cluster problems (node readiness, scheduling issues, restarts) are hard to detect and troubleshoot.

* *Recommended fix:*
** Enable AKS monitoring so kube events + container logs + node/pod inventory signals are collected and visible centrally.
