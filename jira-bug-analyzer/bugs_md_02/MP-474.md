# MP-474: No validation of name_prefix

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
The name_prefix variable can be currently set to any value. The issue is that some Azure resources such as storage account must not have any special characters and there is a length limit. If name_prefix is set too long or contains special characters, then the final resource names can be too long or contain unsupported characters which will fail the terraform apply and the installer falls into an endless loop which prevents from editing the value in the installer.
