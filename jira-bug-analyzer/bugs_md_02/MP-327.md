# MP-327: "No Data" views are not intuitive and do not explain how to get data

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Multiple views in AI Studio (and other sections with empty lists)  
*Severity:* High  
*Impact:* The user does not know the next step, which blocks progress and increases flow abandonment.

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Path: Dashboard → AI Studio → any view with an empty list
# Open a view with no items
# Observe a simple “No Data” message without context

*Evidence:* Observation during testing

*Recommendation:*

* Add contextual description: why there is no data and what to do next
* Add a clear CTA (e.g., “Create your first …”) directly in the empty state
