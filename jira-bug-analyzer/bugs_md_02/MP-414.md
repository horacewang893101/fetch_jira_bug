# MP-414: Performance - very low Lighthouse Performance / poor Core Web Vitals (LCP, TBT, CLS)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Entire application  
*Severity:* Critical  
*Impact:* Very long time to display main content (LCP ~20s), high TBT and delayed interactions, layout shifting (CLS). Higher risk of abandonment and user frustration.

*Before Example - Lighthouse Results:*

||Screen||Performance||FCP||LCP||Speed Index||TBT||
|AI Studio / My Agent|33/100|5.6s|20.7s|14.9s|1,020ms|
|Dashboard|45/100|*|20.9s|7.1s|*|
|Login|44/100|*|*|*|*|

*Root Causes:*

* Large background image loaded synchronously (Dashboard)
* Images without explicit width/height causing CLS
* Excessive JS execution time
* Unused CSS ~40KB
* Unused JavaScript ~120KB

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Run a Lighthouse audit for any page
# Observe the low Performance score
# Check the metrics: LCP, FCP, TBT, CLS

*Recommendation:*

* Reduce and optimize JS assets, split into chunks (code splitting), lazy load
* Optimize rendering (SSR/SSG where it makes sense)
* Compress images and use modern formats (e.g., WebP), progressive loading
* For Dashboard: consider a CSS gradient instead of heavy background, or lazy/progressive loading for the background
* Reduce unused JS/CSS
* Add explicit width/height for all images to prevent CLS
* Optimize JS execution time (code splitting, defer, async)

*Affected Screens:*

* Login Page (Performance 44/100)
* Dashboard (Performance 45/100)
* AI Studio / My Agent (Performance 33/100)
