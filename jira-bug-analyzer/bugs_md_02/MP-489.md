# MP-489: Review and streamline backend startup logic

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Recommendation:*
Assess whether backend responsibilities can be split into separate services to reduce startup complexity. Refactor heavy initialization tasks that run before readiness. Move non‑critical operations to background or lazy initialization.

*Expected outcome:*
Reduced backend cold‑start duration and improved deployment responsiveness. Lower startup time, smaller images, and improved maintainability.
