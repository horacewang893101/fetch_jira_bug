# MP-433: No debounce time on spam clicking switches/buttons - API spam

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Entire application - switches, refresh buttons  
*Severity:* Critical  
*Impact:* User can spam API requests, leading to excessive server load and potential performance issues.

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Go to Dashboard → Knowledge → Org Workspace → File list
# Open DevTools → Network
# Rapidly click on a switch or refresh button
# Observe that each click generates a separate API request without any debounce/throttle

*Evidence:* Screenshot: [debounce-on-api-requests.png]

*Recommendation:*

* Add debounce/throttle for all actions that generate API requests
* Block multiple clicks on buttons during ongoing requests
* Show loading state on buttons/switches during operations

*Affected Screens:*

* All interactive elements triggering API calls
