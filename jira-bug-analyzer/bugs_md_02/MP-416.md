# MP-416: Missing lazy loading implementation for modules (lazy loading)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Entire application  
*Severity:* Critical  
*Impact:* The entire JavaScript codebase is loaded already on the login page, significantly increasing load time and blocking user interaction.

*Current Behavior:*

* All application modules are loaded at startup
* No per-route code splitting
* Users download code for sections they may never visit

*Before Example:*

* On the login page, the full app JS is downloaded (Admin, AI Studio, Knowledge, Chat, etc.)
* No dynamic imports for individual sections

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Open DevTools → Network
# Go to the login page
# Observe that the entire app JS is downloaded
# Check the total asset size downloaded before login

*Recommendation:*

* Implement lazy loading for application modules/routes
* Use dynamic imports ({{import()}}) for individual sections
* Load only the code required for the current view
* Prefetch upcoming modules in the background after the main view loads
* Consider route-based code splitting

*Expected Behavior After Fix:*

{noformat}Login → loads only login code (~50KB)
Dashboard → lazy load the dashboard module
AI Studio → lazy load the AI Studio module
Admin → lazy load the Admin module (admins only){noformat}
