# MP-432: Every change on tables/lists/views triggers a full API refetch (no cache)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Entire application - tables and lists  
*Severity:* Critical  
*Impact:* Excessive network and server load, slow application performance, poor performance on every table interaction.

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Go to Dashboard → Knowledge → Org Workspace → File list
# Open DevTools → Network
# Perform any change on the list (e.g., toggle switch, refresh)
# Observe that every interaction triggers a full API refetch of the list

*Evidence:* Screenshot: [no-cache-api-spam.png]

*Recommendation:*

* Implement cache for tabular data
* Use partial updates instead of full refetch
* Introduce optimistic UI updates with background sync

*Affected Screens:*

* Knowledge → Org Workspace (file lists)
* All tables and lists in the application
