# MP-421: Prometheus not configured (no workload metrics)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
* *Affected:* All AKS workloads
* *Description:* Prometheus is not configured; workload/container metrics are not available.
* *Impact:* No early warning on saturation/performance regressions; limited capacity planning and SLO monitoring.
* *Recommended fix (what/where):*
** Deploy *Prometheus + Alertmanager* into AKS (or your product’s embedded metrics stack).
** Require each service to expose a {{/metrics}} endpoint and verify scraping via ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor (or annotations).
