# MP-334: Inconsistent loading states across the application (perceived as chaos)

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
*Location:* Multiple views and components  
*Severity:* High  
*Impact:* Users see different “versions” of loading UI, reducing consistency and trust.

*Description:*
This is not only about button loading — different loading patterns across the application create a sense of chaos.

*Reproduction Steps:*

# Repro path: AI Studio → Create an agent → Loading state of the newly created agent edit view
# Create a new agent
# Observe the loading state during the transition to the edit view
# Example path: Knowledge → Org Workspace → Add Knowledge Base → Classification
# Open dropdowns/components dependent on data
# Observe inconsistent behavior/text/loading states (e.g., “loading”, spinner, placeholders)

*Evidence:* Observation during testing

*Recommendation:*

* Standardize loading states (texts, spinners, skeletons) for components
* Avoid using “loading” as a placeholder in inputs/comboboxes
