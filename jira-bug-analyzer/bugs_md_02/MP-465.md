# MP-465: Recommendation - Inconsistent/misused HTTP status codes across endpoints

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
* Business validation (e.g., duplicate category name) returns *200* with error payload ({{code: 4002}}, message in Chinese).
* Empty body often returns *422*, elsewhere *400*, sometimes *500*.
* Some endpoints respond *405*, likely method mismatch in collection.
This breaks client/gateway semantics and monitoring. Standardize: 4xx for client errors (e.g., *409* conflict, *400* bad request), 5xx only for server faults.

200 should be used only for success; conflicts use 409; missing/invalid body uses 400; validations use 422 (if adopted) consistently.
