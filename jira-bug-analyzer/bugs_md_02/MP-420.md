# MP-420: Azure Database for PostgreSQL logs/metrics not collected

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
* *Affected:* Azure Database for PostgreSQL
* *Description:* No logs are collected for the managed PostgreSQL instance.
* *Impact:* Database incidents (timeouts, saturation, connection failures) can’t be diagnosed or correlated with application failures.
* *Recommended fix:*
** On the *PostgreSQL resource*, enable *Diagnostic settings* and send logs + metrics to the central log destination.
** Validate by confirming PostgreSQL logs/metrics are queryable centrally for a known time window.
