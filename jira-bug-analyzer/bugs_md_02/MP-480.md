# MP-480: Health probes exist only for backend; most workloads have no probes

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
Only backend defines liveness/readiness probes; knowledge/celery/frontend/mcpm/translator have none.

Risk: Kubernetes can’t reliably detect “alive but broken” states; rollouts may hang or succeed with broken pods; SLOs/alerts are unreliable without health signals.
