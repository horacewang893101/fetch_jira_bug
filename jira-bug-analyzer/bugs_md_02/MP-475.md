# MP-475: Unable to view whole terraform plan before starting installation

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
The terraform plan size exceeds the typical screen height, and it is impossible to scroll up to view the entire plan before typing ‘yes’. Mouse scroll and keyboard navigation keys such as page up/down, arrows are registered as character input, not as the intended action.
