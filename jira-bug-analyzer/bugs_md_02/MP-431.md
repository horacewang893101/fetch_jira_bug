# MP-431: [Recommendation] Create an operational health dashboard

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
No operational health dashboard is available after installation, so the team lacks a single place to view AKS workload status plus application and dependency health in one view.

*Impact:* Slower incident triage and root-cause analysis due to context switching between components/tools, increasing MTTR.

*Recommended fix:*

* Build one operational “single pane of glass” dashboard: AKS readiness/restarts + app rate/errors/latency + PostgreSQL/Redis/Key Vault/VMSS health, with filters (service/namespace/time) and drill-down to matching logs/traces.
