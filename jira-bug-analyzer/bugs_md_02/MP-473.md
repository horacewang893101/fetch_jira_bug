# MP-473: Key Vault safety controls weakened

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
Key Vault is configured without purge protection and with purge permissions. 

Risk: An attacker (or accidental admin action) can permanently delete secrets; recovery becomes impossible and can cause full-service outage.
