# MP-478: Kubeconfig written to disk + copied to user home

**Status:** Backlog

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Description:**
The AKS kubeconfig is written to a file under outputs, then copied into {{~/.kube/config}}. 

Risk: Cluster-admin-like access may persist on disk longer than intended and can be exfiltrated from the container or developer machine.
